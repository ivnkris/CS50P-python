In a file called plates.py, reimplement Vanity Plates from Problem Set 2, restructuring your code per the below, wherein is_valid still expects a str as input and returns True if that str meets all requirements and False if it does not, but main is only called if the value of **name** is "**main**":

def main():
...

def is_valid(s):
...

if **name** == "**main**":
main()
Then, in a file called test*plates.py, implement four or more functions that collectively test your implementation of is_valid thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test* so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_plates.py
